    <td><h1>Todd</h1><br><br><br><font size="-1"><strong>Todd Monsen was the fifth member inducted into tuff out of the six.  You can tell by the photos that Todd displays true tuffness.  As a young boy, Todd dreamt of big things.  Things like playing in the NFL, NBA, and MLB all at once; dreams of unbelievable riches and power.  But never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined what an accomplishment being in the tuff is.  He feels truly privileged  to have this opportunity.  He recalls with sweet reminiscing the day that he was informed that a vote had been taken and he was the newest tuff member.  He has always believed in true tuffness, the fact that being tuff is not being physically "tough" but having a tuff mind and a tuff heart.  That's what it's all about.
